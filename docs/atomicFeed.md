# Atomic feeds

Atomic feeds are one of the key features of the IoT Hub. 
Atomic feeds enables the IoT Hub to expose resources such as IoT devices and third-party services to the IoT Hub via the REST API.

## Concept of atomic feeds

Atomic feeds are using IoT Hub plugins to make a bridge between the devices/services and the IoT Hub. As the IoT Hub integrates an IoT Hub script engine, plugins can be imported to the hub to enable the communication with the IoT devices.
